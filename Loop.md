# Day 1 — Odysseus

You are building day 1 of Odysseus, a minimal agent harness in Python. Standard
library only, no third-party packages, Python 3.10+.

Set up the repository first. Create a project folder, run git init, add a
.gitignore with __pycache__/, *.pyc, .DS_Store, and commit after each working
milestone. All harness code lives in a package folder named odysseus/ at the repo
root — create an empty odysseus/__init__.py now (day 4 fills it) — and demos
live in demos/. By day 4, python3 -m odysseus will run from the root.

Code standard, which applies today and every following day. This build is the
reference implementation students keep for years, not scratch code. Every file
opens with a module docstring naming the day, the concept the file teaches, and
the design rules it embodies. Every public function carries a docstring. Where
behavior is subtle — the thought-signature echo, the edit uniqueness rule, the
torn-line tolerance — a short comment states the constraint the code serves.
Size targets, within roughly ten percent and including documentation:
provider.py 105 lines, loop.py 65, tools.py 155, security.py 60, context.py 50,
memory.py 50, skills.py 50, session.py 65, subagent.py 27, harness.py 125,
cli.py 80, fleet.py 36 — about 894 lines for the finished package. Landing far
under a target means documentation was skipped, not that elegance was achieved.

## provider.py

Write odysseus/provider.py to this exact contract.
- Constants: API_ROOT = "https://generativelanguage.googleapis.com/v1beta/models",
  DEFAULT_MODEL = "gemini-3.1-pro-preview".
- api_key(): read ODYSSEUS_API_KEY, fall back to GEMINI_API_KEY, raise
  RuntimeError with a clear message when neither is set.
- complete(model, system, messages, tools) returns {"text": str, "tool_calls":
  [{"name", "args", "signature"}], "usage": {"input": int, "output": int}}. It
  posts systemInstruction {"parts": [{"text": system}]}, contents from
  _to_wire(messages), generationConfig {"temperature": 0.4, "maxOutputTokens":
  65536}, and, when tools are given (a list of spec dicts, each {"schema": ...}),
  tools = [{"functionDeclarations": [t["schema"] for t in tools]}].
- The neutral message format: {"role": "user", "text"}; {"role": "assistant",
  "text", "tool_calls"}; {"role": "tool", "name", "text"}. _to_wire maps user to a
  user text part; assistant to role "model" with a text part when text is
  non-empty plus one functionCall part per tool call, echoing the stored
  signature as thoughtSignature on that part (Gemini 3 requires this round-trip);
  tool to role "user" with a functionResponse part {"name": name, "response":
  {"result": text}}.
- Response parsing: concatenate text parts, skipping parts flagged "thought";
  collect each functionCall part as {"name", "args", "signature":
  part.get("thoughtSignature")}; read usageMetadata promptTokenCount and
  candidatesTokenCount into usage.
- _post(url, body, retries=5): urllib, Content-Type application/json, timeout
  600. On HTTP 429/500/502/503: sleep 2**attempt * 2 seconds and retry. On other
  HTTP errors: raise RuntimeError with the status and the first 400 characters of
  the error body. Retry URLError/TimeoutError the same way.

## loop.py

Write odysseus/loop.py to this exact contract.
- run_loop(model, system, messages, tools, on_event, before_tool, max_turns=80,
  before_turn=None) -> str. tools is a dict name -> Tool, where a Tool exposes
  .spec (a {"schema": ...} dict) and .run (a callable taking keyword
  arguments); the loop hands the provider [t.spec for t in tools.values()]. on_event(kind, payload) fires with "assistant" after
  each model reply, and "tool_start" / "tool_end" around each execution.
  before_tool(call) returns None to allow or a reason string to block; a blocked
  call gets the tool result "BLOCKED: <reason>". before_turn, when provided, is
  called with the message list before each model call and its return value
  replaces the list in place — leave it unused today; day 3 plugs compaction in
  here.
- Each turn: provider.complete, append {"role": "assistant", "text",
  "tool_calls"}, emit the event. No tool calls: return the text. Otherwise run
  each call in order and append {"role": "tool", "name", "text": str(result)}.
- Unknown tool: result "ERROR: unknown tool <name>". Tool exception: result
  "ERROR: <ExceptionType>: <message>". The loop never crashes because a tool did.
- When max_turns runs out: append a user message "Turn limit reached; wrap up
  now.", make one final call with no tools, append and return its text.

## demos/day1_dice.py

Write demos/day1_dice.py: a hand-written roll_dice tool — a small object with
.spec = {"schema": {"name": "roll_dice", "description": "Roll count six-sided
dice", "parameters": {"type": "object", "properties": {"count": {"type":
"string", "description": "How many dice"}}, "required": ["count"]}}} and .run
returning the rolls — plus a printing on_event, an always-allow before_tool, and
the task "Roll 3 dice and tell me whether the total beats 10".

## Verification

Verify before finishing: (1) the dice transcript shows user, assistant tool call,
tool result, assistant answer; (2) the prompt "Build a landing page for a coffee
shop" returns text and no tool calls; (3) git log shows the day's commits.
