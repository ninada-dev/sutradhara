You are building day 3 of Odysseus. Cumulative state: odysseus/ contains
provider.py, loop.py (with the before_turn socket still unused), tools.py (Tool,
@tool, core_tools with the path jail), security.py (Policy, deny rules), and
demos/ from days 1-2. Today adds the context engine, durable memory, and skills.
Do not rewrite earlier files; plug in. The day-1 code standard applies.
Commit as you go.

Write odysseus/context.py to this exact contract.
- CHARS_PER_TOKEN = 4, KEEP_RECENT = 6.
- estimate_tokens(messages): total len(str(message)) over the list, divided by
  CHARS_PER_TOKEN.
- compact(model, messages, budget_tokens): within budget, or when the list has
  at most KEEP_RECENT + 1 messages, return it unchanged. Otherwise split into
  old and the last KEEP_RECENT; render the old messages into a plain transcript
  (role, tool name when present, text clipped per message, tool calls named);
  one provider.complete call with the system instruction "You compress agent
  transcripts. Preserve: the original task, every file created or edited and its
  purpose, key decisions, unresolved errors, and what remains to be done. Be
  dense and factual."; return [one user message "[Conversation so far,
  compacted]
<summary>"] + the recent slice.
- The kept slice must not begin with an orphaned tool result: drop leading tool
  messages from it before returning.
- Wire it in: the harness will pass before_turn=lambda msgs:
  compact(model, msgs, budget_tokens) — for today, demos pass it directly to
  run_loop.

Write odysseus/memory.py to this exact contract.
- MEMORY_FILE = "ODYSSEUS.md".
- A base system prompt stating: the agent is Odysseus, a small sharp coding
  agent working inside one directory with the tools provided; act, don't
  narrate; inspect before assuming; prefer edit_file for small changes;
  verify after building by running or re-reading; never repeat a failing call
  unchanged; when complete, reply with a short summary and stop calling tools.
- build_system_prompt(workdir, extra=""): the base prompt, plus a line naming
  the platform and the real working directory, plus — when
  workdir/ODYSSEUS.md exists — a section "Project memory (ODYSSEUS.md):" with
  its contents, plus extra when non-empty, joined by blank lines.
- remember(workdir, note): append "- <note>
" to ODYSSEUS.md and return
  "Remembered in ODYSSEUS.md".

Write odysseus/skills.py to this exact contract.
- SKILLS_DIR = "skills".
- catalog(workdir): {name: {"description", "path"}} from every
  workdir/skills/<name>/SKILL.md, reading a "description:" line from the file's
  front matter when present.
- catalog_prompt(workdir): empty string when no skills; otherwise "Skills
  available (load one with the use_skill tool when relevant):" followed by
  "- name: description" lines.
- read_skill(workdir, name): the full SKILL.md text, or "ERROR: no skill named
  <name>. Available: ..." on a miss.

Verify before finishing, all three: (1) with budget_tokens=1500 wired through
before_turn, the task "Create five files one.txt through five.txt, each with 20
lines of the word ping, one write_file at a time with a read back after each;
then MANIFEST.md listing each file and its line count verified with wc -l"
completes correctly and compaction observably fired mid-run; (2) remember() a
fact, then in a completely fresh conversation over the same directory the agent
answers a question about it from the system prompt alone; (3) a
skills/brand-voice skill demanding pirate speak changes the voice of a small
writing task with zero code changes.
