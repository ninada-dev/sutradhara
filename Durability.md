You are building day 4 of Odysseus. Cumulative state: odysseus/ contains
provider.py, loop.py, tools.py, security.py, context.py, memory.py, skills.py.
Today adds the spine — durable sessions, crash repair, sub-agents — and the
Harness class that composes the whole week. Do not rewrite earlier files.
The day-1 code standard applies. Commit as you go.

Write odysseus/session.py to this exact contract.
- SESSION_DIR = ".odysseus/sessions".
- new_session(workdir, label="session"): create the directory, slugify the label
  to alphanumerics and dashes clipped to 40 chars, return the path
  <workdir>/.odysseus/sessions/<unix-timestamp>-<slug>.jsonl.
- append(path, message): one json.dumps line per message, ensure_ascii False.
- load(path): parse line by line; a line that fails to parse is a torn tail —
  stop there, keep everything before it; then run the repair below and return
  the list.
- latest(workdir): newest .jsonl in the session dir, or None.
- The repair: find the last assistant message; count the tool messages after
  it; for each of its tool_calls beyond that count, append {"role": "tool",
  "name": call name, "text": "Interrupted before this ran (process
  restarted)."}. The result always satisfies the call/response pairing rule.

Write odysseus/subagent.py to this exact contract.
- subagent_tool(make_harness, depth=0, max_depth=2) -> Tool, built with the
  @tool decorator: name spawn_agent, description telling the model to delegate
  a self-contained task to a fresh sub-agent with its own clean context, that
  the child cannot see this conversation, and that it returns the child's final
  report; one parameter, task. At or past max_depth it returns "ERROR: sub-agent
  depth limit reached; do this task yourself". Otherwise make_harness(depth+1)
  and return child.run(task).

Write odysseus/harness.py to this exact contract.
- class Harness(workdir=".", model=None, policy=None, extra_tools=None,
  system_extra="", on_event=None, budget_tokens=600_000, max_turns=120,
  session_path=None, enable_subagents=True, persist=True, _depth=0).
- Construction: realpath and create the workdir; model defaults to the
  ODYSSEUS_MODEL env var then provider.DEFAULT_MODEL; policy defaults to
  Policy("yolo"); tools = core_tools(workdir) as a name-keyed dict; add a
  remember tool wrapping memory.remember; when skills exist, add use_skill;
  when enable_subagents, add spawn_agent via a make_child that constructs a
  Harness over the same workdir and policy with persist=False (children are
  ephemeral — a child session log must never hijack --resume); merge
  extra_tools; system prompt = memory.build_system_prompt(workdir, skills
  catalog_prompt + system_extra).
- resume(path=None): load session.latest when no path given; set messages and
  session_path; return True when messages loaded.
- run(task) -> str: when persist and no session_path yet, create one from the
  first 32 chars of the task. Append and record the user message. Record every
  new message as it lands (clamp the recorded index if compaction shrank the
  list). Call loop.run_loop with before_tool=policy.check and
  before_turn=compaction against budget_tokens; return the final text.

Write odysseus/__init__.py exporting Harness, Policy, Tool, tool — and
odysseus/__main__.py deferring to a cli main() (a stub today; day 5 completes
it). Update .gitignore with .odysseus/.

Verify before finishing, both: (1) start "Create part1.txt through part5.txt one
at a time, then SUMMARY.md describing each", kill -9 the process partway, run
again in the same directory calling resume() then run("continue the task") —
the transcript shows the interruption notice and all six files exist at the end;
(2) "Use spawn_agent twice: delegate writing utils.py with a slugify(text)
function to one child, and test_utils.py with five asserts to another; then run
python3 test_utils.py yourself and report" — the parent runs the tests itself,
and .odysseus/sessions contains exactly one session file.
